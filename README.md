# example-SparkFun-MicroMod-nRF52840

This example has been designed for this workshop hosted by SparkFun: [AI Workshop: Meet Your New Fitness Trainer](https://learn.sparkfun.com/events/204_).

This tutorial is using:

**Hardware:**

- [SparkFun MicroMod Machine Learning Carrier Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16400)
![micromod ML](assets/micromod-ml.png)
- [Nordic NRF52840 MicroMod Processor Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16984)
![nrf-processor](assets/nrf-processor.png)

**Tools and Softwares:**

- [Edge Impulse Studio](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com) and [Edge Impulse CLI](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/cli-installation)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Installing the dependencies

### Install Arduino IDE

Download the lastest Arduino version: [https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)

![dl arduino ide](assets/dl-arduino-ide.png)

We have been testing with Arduino 1.8.13. It should work also with the current latest Arduino IDE version (1.8.15). However, we do not recommend to use the Arduino IDE 2.0 beta at the moment as it has some breaking changes.

### Adding the MicroMod nRF52840 Board to Arduino IDE

A complete and official guide is provided in the following link to setup Arduino IDE to run with the nRF52840 Processor board: [https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-nrf52840-processor-hookup-guide/arduino-software-setup](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-nrf52840-processor-hookup-guide/arduino-software-setup).

*Note that recently, Arduino has deprecated the Arduino Mbed OS Boards to provided standalone package for each boards:*

![board-manager-mbded-1.3.1](assets/board-manager-mbded-1.3.1.png)

In order to be able to compile and run this project on the MicroMod nRF52840 Processor, you will need to install the **version `1.3.1`** of this deprecated package. Sparkfun is working on a fix, the official guide should be update once done.

Do not forget to restard your Arduino IDE after having added the board in the application folder.

### Run the data-forwarder-example sketch

To make sure the board works, test the `data-forwarder-example` sketch present in this repository. Just open the `.ino` file or copy past the following code in a new sketch:

```
#include <Wire.h>

#include "SparkFun_LIS2DH12.h" //Click here to get the library: http://librarymanager/All#SparkFun_LIS2DH12
SPARKFUN_LIS2DH12 accel;       //Create instance

#define FREQUENCY_HZ        50
#define INTERVAL_MS         (1000 / (FREQUENCY_HZ + 1))

static unsigned long last_interval = 0;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    delay(2000);
    Serial.println("Accelerometer reading in Serial Console to be forwarded to Edge Impulse");

    Serial.print("FREQUENCY_HZ: ");
    Serial.println(FREQUENCY_HZ);

    Serial.print("INTERVAL_MS: ");
    Serial.println(INTERVAL_MS);

    Wire.begin();

    if (accel.begin() == false)
    {
      Serial.println("Accelerometer not detected. Check address jumper and wiring. Freezing...");
      while (1);
    }else{
      accel.setScale(LIS2DH12_2g);
      Serial.print("Accelerometer scale: ");
      Serial.println(accel.getScale());

      accel.setMode(LIS2DH12_LP_8bit);
      Serial.print("Accelerometer mode: ");
      Serial.println(accel.getMode());

      accel.setDataRate(LIS2DH12_ODR_100Hz);
      Serial.print("Accelerometer data rate: ");
      Serial.println(accel.getDataRate());
    }
    
}

void loop() {
    
    if (millis() > last_interval + INTERVAL_MS) {
        
        last_interval = millis();
  
        Serial.print(accel.getX());
        Serial.print('\t');
        Serial.print(accel.getY());
        Serial.print('\t');
        Serial.println(accel.getZ());   
    }
}
```

You will need to install the accelerometer library, simply click on the link `http://librarymanager/All#SparkFun_LIS2DH12` in the Arduino IDE, it will open the following window:

![ide-lib-manager](assets/ide-lib-manager.png)

Select the `SparkFun MicroMod nRF52840 Processor Board` under `Tools -> Boards -> Arduino Mbed OS Boards`.

![ide-select-board](assets/ide-select-board.png)

Select the Port (note that it is recognized as the Arduino Nano 33 BLE in my environment):

![ide-select-port](assets/ide-select-port.png)

Compile and upload the sketch (using the ‚û°Ô∏è button on the upper left corner). You should get the following results when done:

![ide-upload-successful](assets/ide-upload-successful.png)

On the serial monitor and set the baudrate to `115200`. You will see the three axis values displayed as follow:

![ide-serial-console-data-fwd](assets/ide-serial-console-data-fwd.png)

You can now leave your board connected, we will push the some of data to Edge Impulse in the following section.


## Collecting data

If you do not have an Edge Impulse account yet, start by creating an account on [Edge Impulse Studio](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com) and create a project.

You also need to install [Edge Impulse CLI](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/cli-installation) tools to be able to use the `edge-impulse-data-forwarder`.

### API Keys

On your `Dashboard` view of your Edge Impulse project, navgate to the `Keys` tab and create a new API Key for your CLI:

![studio-create-api-key](assets/studio-create-api-key.png)

Copy your new API key, it looks like something similar to `ei_...`.

### Connect the CLI to your Serial port

Quit the Serial Monitor from your Arduino IDE if still open.

Open a new terminal and run `edge-impulse-data-forwarder --clean --frequency 50Hz`. Follow the prompt to fill the required information:

```
$> edge-impulse-data-forwarder --clean --frequency 50Hz

```

Go back to Edge Impulse Studio and naviagte to the `Devices` view.
Your device is now connected:

![studio-devices](assets/studio-devices.png)

To start collecting some data, go to the `Data acquisition` view, make sure your board is connecting and click on `Start Sampling`:

![data-collection](assets/data-collection.gif)

ü§´ *Disclamer: Edge Impulse rejects any responsibility for the quality of theses jumping jacks. This scene was not made by professionals, please try to reproduce it better, much better!*

Do this process for each label you want to classify. Do not forget to add some samples in your training set by navigating to the `Test data` on the upper left corner of the `Data acquisition` view.

## Train your Machine Learning Model

Once you have collected enough data, navigate the the `Create Impulse` view:

![studio-create-impulse](assets/studio-create-impulse.png)

Add a **Spectral Analysis** DSP Block and a **Neural Network** Learning Block.

Click on `Save Impulse` and go to the `Spectral features` view:

![studio-spectral-features](assets/studio-spectral-features.png)

Here, just change the `Scale axis` value to `0.01`, it will help the quantized version of your Neural Network to get a better accuracy.
Click on `Save parameters` at the bottom of this page. 

You should have been redirected to the `Generate feature` tab.

Click on `Generate feature`, wait few seconds and you should see 4 well separated clusters:

![studio-generate-features](assets/studio-generate-features.png)

If so, this is good! It means your Neural Network will more likely be able to classify your samples easily.

Now navigate to the `NN Classifier` view and click on `Start Training`. With the default parameters, we obtained a **99.4% accuracy** with a model that can run the inference in 1 ms., using 1.5KB of RAM and 15.5KB of ROM on the nRF52840

![studio-nn-classifier](assets/studio-nn-classifier.png)

We tried a slightly modified architecture to see if we could achieve some better results:

![studio-nn-classifier-2](assets/studio-nn-classifier-2.png)

As you can see, we reached a **99.4% accuracy**, however, this model use 1.8KB of RAM. It is completely up to you to choose which model to use, in this case both can easily run on the target.

Now we are satisfied with the Neural Network model, we can test this model on data that have been unknown to the Neural Network. Go to the `Model testing` tab and click on `Classify all`:

![studio-model-testing](assets/studio-model-testing.png)

I guess we can validate this model and go to the next step to test it in real conditions!


## Run your inference on the target

### Download the generated Arduino Library

To deploy your model on the Sparkfun / nRF52840 MicroMod board, we will download the **Arduino Library** from the `Deployment` view on Edge Impulse Studio and click on `Build` at the bottom of the page:

![studio-deployment](assets/studio-deployment.png)

Save the .zip file on your laptop and go back to your arduino IDE.

### Upload the code

Include the generated library in the Arduino IDE and select the .zip file you have just downloaded:

![ide-include-library](assets/ide-include-library.png)

Open the `micromod-nrf52840_accelerometer.ino` sketch from this Github repository or create a new Arduino sketch and copy past the following code:
